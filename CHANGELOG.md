## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Time Kiosk standalone PWA**: The Time Kiosk is now an installable Progressive Web App served at `/kiosk` (web manifest, root-scope service worker, offline app shell) instead of only living inside the desk app. The legacy desk page at `/app/time-kiosk` stays as a fallback and links to the new app.
- **Continuous, battery-aware location tracking**: While clocked in **and active** (not paused), the PWA tracks location on the main thread using `watchPosition` + a movement distance-filter + a periodic heartbeat. Points are persisted to IndexedDB by the service worker and uploaded in batches via a new session-trusted `log_geolocation_batch` endpoint, with Background Sync retry when offline. (Fixes the prior dedicated Web Worker that could never read GPS — `navigator.geolocation` is unavailable in workers.)
- **Location history & timeline**: Each point is tied to its `Job Interval`; new whitelisted `get_location_history` plus a manager-facing **Location Timeline** desk page replay an employee's movements on a Leaflet map.
- **Time Kiosk Settings** (Single doctype): configurable distance filter, heartbeat, GPS accuracy, screen wake-lock, batch size, and retention. A daily scheduled job purges location logs older than the retention window.

### Changed
- **Time Kiosk Log** gains `job_interval`, `accuracy`, `speed`, `heading`, and `altitude` fields, search indexes on `employee`/`timestamp`, and owner-scoped read access for employees.
- **App consolidation**: Merged the previously separate `crm_enhancements`, `global_enhancements`, `project_enhancements`, `task_enhancements`, and `qb_time_integration` apps into `erpnext_enhancements`. Each is now a Frappe module within this single app (CRM Enhancements, Global Enhancements, Project Enhancements, Task Enhancements, QuickBooks Time Integration). Their hooks, patches, fixtures, and public assets were merged; incoming public assets are namespaced under `public/{js,css}/<module>/` to avoid collisions. The standalone apps are no longer required — uninstall them from existing benches after deploying this release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-27

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-22

### Added
- **Time Kiosk**: A simplified, tablet-friendly interface for employees to log time against projects and tasks. Supports geolocation logging and syncing to Timesheets.
